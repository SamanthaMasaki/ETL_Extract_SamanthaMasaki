# ETL_Extract_SamanthaMasaki

## Description
- This project, "ETL Extract Lab," focuses on the Extract phase of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. 
- The accompanying Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to retrieve data from a specified source, making it ready for subsequent transformation and loading steps. 
- Specifically, it will showcase the process of reading a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

## Tool used
- Python: The primary programming language used for data manipulation.
- pandas: A powerful Python library for data analysis and manipulation, particularly for working with tabular data.
- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment used to develop, document, and run the code.

## How to reproduce:
### How to Run the Notebook
- sEnsure you have Python and Jupyter installed.
- Download the project files (including the ETL_Extract_Lab.ipynb notebook and the data.csv file if applicable) to your local machine.
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you saved the project files using the cd command (e.g., cd /path/to/your/project).
- Launch Jupyter Notebook by typing jupyter notebook and pressing Enter.
A web browser will open, displaying the Jupyter Notebook interface.
- Click on the ETL_Extract_Lab.ipynb file to open the notebook.
- Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially by clicking on a cell and pressing Shift + Enter, or by going to Cell -> Run All.

### Where the data comes from
- The data used in this lab is sourced from a local CSV file named data.csv. This file is assumed to be located in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook (ETL_Extract_Lab.ipynb). For the purpose of this lab, it represents a typical scenario where data is extracted from a flat file.
